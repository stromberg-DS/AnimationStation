rc.local

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

before the exit 0 line, add execution line using absolute path followed by &
& sets the program in a different thread so the boot process can continue.

.bashrc
 
modify the .bashrc  file. Your program 
will run when you log in and also every time when a new terminal 
is opened, or when a new SSH connection is made. Put your command at the 
bottom of /home/pi/.bashrc

init.d directory

sudo cp /home/pi/sample.py /etc/init.d/
cd /etc/init.d
sudo nano sample.py

Enter into the script file
# /etc/init.d/sample.py
### BEGIN INIT INFO

### END INIT INFO


crontab

sudo crontab -e

@reboot sudo python /home/pi/Desktop/pyprog/pytest.py
 /home/pi/Desktop/pyprog/log.txt

All these methods seem to run in the background or not at all 


To wait until X windows is up before executing it seeems 
autostart is the only way

Desktop environment is LXDE-pi

mkdir /home/pi/.config/autostart
nano /home/pi/.config/autostart/clock.desktop

Enter:
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Clock
Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/clock.py

If a program needs a terminal window the usual treminal
execution does not work. Instead, install:

sudo apt-get install xterm

then the autostart is this:

[Desktop Entry]
Comment=Type=Application
Name=Animation
Comment=Exec=lxterminal /home/rpi/projects/Animation/main
Exec=/usr/bin/lxterm /home/rpi/projects/Animation/main

It seems all files in /home/rpi/.config/autostart are run
on startup. Not sure buyt there is a LXInput.autostart added 
when lxterm was inbstalled.
