Many site say to install and us unclutter. However it seems to be 
no longer available. When it is, it allows the cursor to disappear
with the command line:

unclutter -idle 0

This makes the cursor disappear only when the mose is not moving.

The less desireable alternative makes the cursor always invisible
but keeps the mouse working. To do this:

sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

and add the line:

xserver-command = X -nocursor

Although the mouse still works it seems pretty flakey. But you can open
a terminal a edit the file and remove the line to get the cursor back.
